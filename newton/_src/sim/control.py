    Time-varying control data includes joint torques, control inputs, muscle activations,

        Array of generalized joint forces [N or N·m, depending on joint type] with shape ``(joint_dof_count,)``
        and type ``float``.

        The degrees of freedom for free joints are included in this array and have the same
        convention as the :attr:`newton.State.body_f` array where the 6D wrench is defined as
        ``(f_x, f_y, f_z, t_x, t_y, t_z)``, where ``f_x``, ``f_y``, and ``f_z`` are the components
        of the force vector (linear) [N] and ``t_x``, ``t_y``, and ``t_z`` are the
        components of the torque vector (angular) [N·m]. For free joints, the wrench is applied in world frame with the
        body's center of mass (COM) as reference point.

        .. note::
            The Featherstone solver currently applies free-joint forces in the body-origin frame instead of the
            center-of-mass frame, which can lead to unexpected rotation when applying linear force to a body with a non-zero COM offset.
