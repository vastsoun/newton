@dataclass
class GeometryDescriptor(Descriptor):
    """
    A container to describe a generic geometry entity.

    A geometry entity is an abstraction to represent the composition of a
    shape, with a pose w.r.t the world frame of a scene. Each geometry entity
    is assigned to a single body, and is organized into one of the distinct
    geometry sets called 'layers'. Each geometry descriptor bundles the unique
    object identifiers of the entity, indices to the associated body and layer,
    the offset pose w.r.t. the body, and a shape descriptor.

    Attributes:
        bid (int): Index of the body to which the geometry entity is attached.\n
            Defaults to `-1`, indicating that the geometry has not yet been assigned to a body.\n
            The value `-1` also indicates that the geometry, by default, is statically attached to the world.
        shape (ShapeDescriptorType | None): Definition of the shape of the geometry entity.
            See :class:`ShapeDescriptorType` for the list of supported shape types.
        offset (transformf): Offset pose transform of the geometry entity w.r.t. its corresponding body.\n
            Defaults to the identity transform with zero translation and identity rotation quaternion.
        wid (int): Index of the world to which the body belongs.\n
            Defaults to `-1`, indicating that the body has not yet been added to a world.
        gid (int): Index of the geometry w.r.t. its world.\n
