    Provides an implementation of a Semi-Implicit Euler time-stepping integrator.

    Effectively, the Semi-Implicit Euler scheme involves an implicit solve of the
    forward dynamics to render constraint reactions at the start of the time-step,
    followed by an explicit forward integration step to compute the next state:

    ```
    lambda = f_fd(q_p, u_p, tau_j)
    u_n = u_p + M^{-1} * ( dt * h(q_p, u_p) + dt * J_a(q_p)^T * tau_j + J_c(q_p)^T * lambda )
    q_n = q_p + dt * G(q_p) @ u_n
    ```

    where `q_p` and `u_p` are the generalized coordinates and velocities at the start of the
    time-step, `q_n` and `u_n` are the generalized coordinates and velocities at the end of
    the time-step, `M` is the generalized mass matrix, `h` is the vector of generalized
    non-linear forces, `J_a` is the actuation Jacobian matrix, `tau_j` is the vector of
    generalized forces, `J_c` is the constraint Jacobian matrix, and `lambda` are the
    constraint reactions.
