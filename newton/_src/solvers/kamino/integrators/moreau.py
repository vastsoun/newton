class IntegratorMoreauJean(IntegratorBase):
    """
    Provides an implementation of a semi-implicit Moreau-Jean
    time-stepping integrator for non-smooth dynamical systems.

    Effectively, the Moreau-Jean scheme involves the following three steps:

    1. An initial explicit forward integration of the generalized coordinates
       using the generalized velocities at the start of the time-step to render
       an intermediate configuration at the mid-point of the time-step.

    2. An implicit solve of the forward dynamics using the generalized coordinates
       evaluated at the mid-point of the discrete time-step together with the initial
       generalized velocities to render constraint reactions.

    3. A final explicit forward integration of the generalized coordinates and velocities
       using the constraint reactions computed at the mid-point of the time-step to render
       the next state of the system at the end of the time-step.

    These steps can be summarized by the following equations:
    ```
    1: q_m = q_p + 1/2 * dt * G(q_p) * u_p
    2: lambdas = f_fd(q_m, u_p, tau_j)
    3: u_n = u_p + M(q_m)^{-1} * ( dt * h(q_m, u_p) + dt * J_a(q_m)^T * tau_j + J_c(q_m)^T * lambdas )
    4: q_n = q_m + 1/2 * dt * G(q_m) @ u_n
    ```

    where `q_p` and `u_p` are the generalized coordinates and velocities at the start of the
    time-step, `q_m` is the intermediate configuration at the mid-point of the time-step,
    `q_n` and `u_n` are the generalized coordinates and velocities at the end of the time-step.

    `M(q_m)` is the generalized mass matrix, `h(q_m, u_p)` is the vector of generalized
    non-linear forces, `J_a(q_m)` is the actuation Jacobian matrix, `J_c(q_m)` is the
    constraint Jacobian matrix, all evaluated at the mid-point configuration `q_m`.

    `tau_j` is the vector of generalized forces provided at the start of the
    time-step, and `lambdas` are the resulting constraint reactions computed
    at the mid-point from the forward dynamics sub-problem.
