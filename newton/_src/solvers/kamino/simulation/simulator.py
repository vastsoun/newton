class Simulator:
    """
    A high-level interface for executing physics simulations using Kamino.

    The Simulator class encapsulates the entire simulation pipeline, including model definition,
    state management, collision detection, constraint handling, and time integration.

    A Simulator is typically instantiated from a :class:`ModelBuilder` that defines the model
    to be simulated. The simulator manages the time-stepping loop, invoking callbacks at various
    stages of the simulation step, and provides access to the current state and control inputs.

    Example:
    ```python
        # Create a model builder and define the model
        builder = ModelBuilder()

        # Define the model components (e.g., bodies, joints, collision geometries etc.)
        builder.add_rigid_body(...)
        builder.add_joint(...)
        builder.add_collision_geometry(...)

        # Create the simulator from the builder
        simulator = Simulator(builder)

        # Run the simulation for a specified number of steps
