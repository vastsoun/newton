    Notes:
    - The length of the arrays is determined by the maximum number of iterations
    and is filled up to the number of iterations performed by the solver on each
    solve. This allows for post-solve analysis of the convergence behavior.
    - This has a significant impact on solver performance and memory usage, so it
    is recommended to only enable this for testing and debugging purposes.
