    """Parses a Universal Scene Description (USD) stage containing UsdPhysics schema definitions for rigid-body articulations and adds the bodies, shapes and joints to the given ModelBuilder.

    The USD description has to be either a path (file name or URL), or an existing USD stage instance that implements the `Stage <https://openusd.org/dev/api/class_usd_stage.html>`_ interface.

    See :ref:`usd_parsing` for more information.

    Args:
        builder (ModelBuilder): The :class:`ModelBuilder` to add the bodies and joints to.
        source (str | pxr.Usd.Stage): The file path to the USD file, or an existing USD stage instance.
        xform (Transform): The transform to apply to the entire scene.
        floating (bool or None): Controls the base joint type for the root body (bodies not connected as
            a child to any joint).

            - ``None`` (default): Uses format-specific default (creates a FREE joint for USD bodies without joints).
            - ``True``: Creates a FREE joint with 6 DOF (3 translation + 3 rotation). Only valid when
              ``parent_body == -1`` since FREE joints must connect to world frame.
            - ``False``: Creates a FIXED joint (0 DOF).

            Cannot be specified together with ``base_joint``.
        base_joint (dict): Custom joint specification for connecting the root body to the world
            (or to ``parent_body`` if specified). This parameter enables hierarchical composition with
            custom mobility. Dictionary with joint parameters as accepted by
            :meth:`ModelBuilder.add_joint` (e.g., joint type, axes, limits, stiffness).

            Cannot be specified together with ``floating``.
        parent_body (int): Parent body index for hierarchical composition. If specified, attaches the
            imported root body to this existing body, making them part of the same kinematic articulation.
            The connection type is determined by ``floating`` or ``base_joint``. If ``-1`` (default),
            the root connects to the world frame. **Restriction**: Only the most recently added
            articulation can be used as parent; attempting to attach to an older articulation will raise
            a ``ValueError``.

            .. note::
               Valid combinations of ``floating``, ``base_joint``, and ``parent_body``:

        only_load_enabled_rigid_bodies (bool): If True, only rigid bodies which do not have `physics:rigidBodyEnabled` set to False are loaded.
        only_load_enabled_joints (bool): If True, only joints which do not have `physics:jointEnabled` set to False are loaded.
        joint_drive_gains_scaling (float): The default scaling of the PD control gains (stiffness and damping), if not set in the PhysicsScene with as "newton:joint_drive_gains_scaling".
        verbose (bool): If True, print additional information about the parsed USD file. Default is False.
        ignore_paths (List[str]): A list of regular expressions matching prim paths to ignore.
        collapse_fixed_joints (bool): If True, fixed joints are removed and the respective bodies are merged. Only considered if not set on the PhysicsScene as "newton:collapse_fixed_joints".
        enable_self_collisions (bool): Determines the default behavior of whether self-collisions are enabled for all shapes within an articulation. If an articulation has the attribute ``physxArticulation:enabledSelfCollisions`` defined, this attribute takes precedence.
        apply_up_axis_from_stage (bool): If True, the up axis of the stage will be used to set :attr:`newton.ModelBuilder.up_axis`. Otherwise, the stage will be rotated such that its up axis aligns with the builder's up axis. Default is False.
        root_path (str): The USD path to import, defaults to "/".
        joint_ordering (str): The ordering of the joints in the simulation. Can be either "bfs" or "dfs" for breadth-first or depth-first search, or ``None`` to keep joints in the order in which they appear in the USD. Default is "dfs".
        bodies_follow_joint_ordering (bool): If True, the bodies are added to the builder in the same order as the joints (parent then child body). Otherwise, bodies are added in the order they appear in the USD. Default is True.
        skip_mesh_approximation (bool): If True, mesh approximation is skipped. Otherwise, meshes are approximated according to the ``physics:approximation`` attribute defined on the UsdPhysicsMeshCollisionAPI (if it is defined). Default is False.
        load_sites (bool): If True, sites (prims with MjcSiteAPI) are loaded as non-colliding reference points. If False, sites are ignored. Default is True.
        load_visual_shapes (bool): If True, non-physics visual geometry is loaded. If False, visual-only shapes are ignored (sites are still controlled by ``load_sites``). Default is True.
        hide_collision_shapes (bool): If True, collision shapes are hidden. Default is False.
        parse_mujoco_options (bool): Whether MuJoCo solver options from the PhysicsScene should be parsed. If False, solver options are not loaded and custom attributes retain their default values. Default is True.
        mesh_maxhullvert (int): Maximum vertices for convex hull approximation of meshes. Note that an authored ``newton:maxHullVertices`` attribute on any shape with a ``NewtonMeshCollisionAPI`` will take priority over this value.
        schema_resolvers (list[SchemaResolver]): Resolver instances in priority order. Default is to only parse Newton-specific attributes.
            Schema resolvers collect per-prim "solver-specific" attributes, see :ref:`schema_resolvers` for more information.
            These include namespaced attributes such as ``newton:*``, ``physx*``
            (e.g., ``physxScene:*``, ``physxRigidBody:*``, ``physxSDFMeshCollision:*``), and ``mjc:*`` that
            are authored in the USD but not strictly required to build the simulation. This is useful for
            inspection, experimentation, or custom pipelines that read these values via
            :attr:`newton.usd.SchemaResolverManager.schema_attrs`.

            .. note::
                Using the ``schema_resolvers`` argument is an experimental feature that may be removed or changed significantly in the future.
        force_position_velocity_actuation (bool): If True and both stiffness (kp) and damping (kd)
            are non-zero, joints use :attr:`~newton.ActuatorMode.POSITION_VELOCITY` actuation mode.
            If False (default), actuator modes are inferred per joint via :func:`newton.ActuatorMode.from_gains`:
            :attr:`~newton.ActuatorMode.POSITION` if stiffness > 0, :attr:`~newton.ActuatorMode.VELOCITY` if only
            damping > 0, :attr:`~newton.ActuatorMode.EFFORT` if a drive is present but both gains are zero
            (direct torque control), or :attr:`~newton.ActuatorMode.NONE` if no drive/actuation is applied.

    Returns:
        dict: Dictionary with the following entries:
